The game is a scifi Vampire Survivors x Tower defense.

You play as an engineer with a "repair shotgun". You have to build/protect turrets.
Your turrets deal the most damage, however you can damage enemies with your shotgun as well.
Your shotgun's other purpose is to heal your turrets.
It costs currency ("Metal") to shoot your shotgun and to build new turrets.
"Metal" is dropped by enemies. (Maybe XP as well?)

Enemies spawn endlessly and ramp up in difficulty over time.
The goal is to survive as long as possible.
